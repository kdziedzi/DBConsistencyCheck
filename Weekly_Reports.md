# Reports

## Week 1

* Created VM instances from the cern Open Stack resources.

* Created [Direction.md](https://github.com/aerophile/DBConsistencyCheck/blob/master/Direction.md) document.

* The format for the inconsistency reporting log files was decided and agreed upon. (See [Direction.md](https://github.com/aerophile/DBConsistencyCheck/blob/master/Direction.md) )

* Downloaded and installed SQL Developer, which was especially troublesome for configuring jdk and took way too much time and too many attempts to get it working.

* Access to copies of oracle databases of DBS and PhEDX were obtained and connections were made and tested through SQLdeveloper and SQLplus.

* Studied Schema descriptions for DBS (BLOCKS) and PhEDX (T_DPS_BLOCKS) databases.   


* Working on step 2 of the approach as described in the direction document and creating stored procedures to perform basic consistency verification steps.
